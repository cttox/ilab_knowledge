# Invoice Cancellation Procedure

This document outlines the procedure for cancelling an invoice in compliance with SAT regulations.

## Steps to Cancel an Invoice

1. **Ask for Cancellation Reason**
   Request the user to provide a cancellation reason allowed by SAT. The options are:
   - **01:** Invoice with error with relation
   - **02:** Invoice with error without relation
   - **03:** Operation was not done

2. **Cancel in Odoo**
   In the Odoo system, press the button **"Cancel only in SAT"**.

3. **Customer Approval**
   Ask the customer to accept the cancellation in their tributable mailbox.

4. **Final Cancellation**
   Once the customer accepts the cancellation, go back to Odoo and cancel the invoice itself.

5. **Send Cancellation Voucher**
   After the invoice is cancelled, send the cancellation voucher to the customer.

## Note
Ensure all steps are followed correctly to maintain compliance with SAT regulations.
